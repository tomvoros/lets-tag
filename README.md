* Updated Let's Tag to support the current version of vgmdb.net
* Updated the link in the About window to point to GitHub

#### Version 0.2.1 (May 23, 2009)

#### Version 0.2 (May 11, 2009)
* Cover art is downloaded and displayed. It can be copied to the clipboard (for pasting into Mp3tag) or saved to a file.
